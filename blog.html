            </h2>
            <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

            <h2 class="card-title">What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
            <p>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. 
            Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
            ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

            </h2>
            <p>An Event Loop is a programming construct that allows for asynchronous programming and can be used to improve the performance of an application. If you’re applying for a position that involves Event Loop programming, it’s important to be prepared to answer questions about your experience and knowledge. In this article, we review some common Event Loop interview questions and provide guidance on how to answer them.
